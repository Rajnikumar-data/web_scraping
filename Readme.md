# Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup4

## BeautifulSoup is the Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML(Extensible Markup language) files. Web scraping is parsing the content of the website and pulling out the information required. Pulled out information can be saved in any format for future use.

## Requirements: install beautifulSoup4, parser (like lxml) and requests library using pip install. There are different parsers that can be used with beautiful soap but lxml is condiedered best.

## Ths method is best when data requied is not large but for large data API call is the best method as it does not effect the traffic on the website there smooth working.


## Source code search (website > go to three dots on the right hand side > more tools > developer tool > source code)

## Search for the blocks in the search code according to your requirement.

## Elements of block are separated by period(.)

## This project is inspired from Corey Schafer youtube channel.
